Description:
    For this project I looked to do something I have always wanted but couldn't find myself online. Me and my friends like to challenge ourselves when we play Pokemon games to make 
them even harder. These challenges are called Nuzzlockes and during a nuzzlocke there is a lot of information you need to remember and record but I haven't found a resource that will
allow you to track those things online. There are some resources out there that you could use but they are mostly disorgaznized, not user friendly, and hard to interact with. I aim
to change that by reorganizing this information in a new way that you could also keep track of what you used to be succerssful. Eventually I would like to attached the Pokemon API
but for this project I am going to focus on adding a follow/frineds system so that you can see what other people have done to be successful in their runs.
